    <p>Today, January 3, 2025, in an ironic attempt to fix my sleep schedule, I decided not to sleep at all. This week, I had been aiming to wake up at 7 a.m., but I always failed—something just wasn’t right. While staying awake, I started watching a YouTube video from Veritasium titled “The 4 Things It Takes to Be an Expert,” and it made me reflect deeply on the topic.</p>

<p>To me, memory has always been a strange topic. I remember, during my bachelor’s degree, after completing the differential equations course, attending a Circuit Theory lecture. The professor wrote a capacitor and its formula on the board and asked us, “What is this equation?” None of us, including me, were able to recognize it. (I mean, nobody said anything, but I certainly didn’t recognize it.) It turned out to be a differential equation. That was the moment I realized my memory was poor. I tried, and somehow I completed my bachelor’s degree by focusing on understanding rather than memorizing. I even recall my friend urging me to memorize one formula before the EMW exam, but I refused because it seemed nonsensical—and it was on the exam. Then, I just smiled.</p>

<p>Fast forward to today, I always feel like my memorization skills are poor, and I’ve never tried to improve them. Now, I can feel that this decision is affecting me—in my master’s degree courses and while learning Italian. To be honest, I’ve never pushed myself to learn Italian; I always started but struggled with consistency. I kept looking for the best ways to learn, but I never did the necessary work. The memory issue was also one of my delusional excuses. </p>

<p>From this year I am chancing my approch since I have 2 hard exam left and I want to learn italian. In my mind I want to create tabu style memory card so I can remeber words also I can see link to the other words. In addition I also bought Radxa Zero 3W 1gb. In my future blog post I want to post about it.</p>

<p>4 things:
deliberate practice, 
feedback, 
supportive environment,
passion</p>
