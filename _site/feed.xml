This week, I had been aiming to wake up at 7 a.m., but I always failed—something just wasn’t right. While staying awake, I started watching a YouTube video from Veritasium titled “The 4 Things It Takes to Be an Expert,” and it made me reflect deeply on the topic.</p>

<p>To me, memory has always been a strange topic. I remember, during my bachelor’s degree, after completing the differential equations course, attending a Circuit Theory lecture. The professor wrote a capacitor and its formula on the board and asked us, “What is this equation?” None of us, including me, were able to recognize it. (I mean, nobody said anything, but I certainly didn’t recognize it.) It turned out to be a differential equation. That was the moment I realized my memory was poor. I tried, and somehow I completed my bachelor’s degree by focusing on understanding rather than memorizing. I even recall my friend urging me to memorize one formula before the EMW exam, but I refused because it seemed nonsensical—and it was on the exam. Then, I just smiled.</p>

<p>Fast forward to today, I always feel like my memorization skills are poor, and I’ve never tried to improve them. Now, I can feel that this decision is affecting me—in my master’s degree courses and while learning Italian. To be honest, I’ve never pushed myself to learn Italian; I always started but struggled with consistency. I kept looking for the best ways to learn, but I never did the necessary work. The memory issue was also one of my delusional excuses. </p>

<p>From this year I am chancing my approch since I have 2 hard exam left and I want to learn italian. In my mind I want to create tabu style memory card so I can remeber words also I can see link to the other words. In addition I also bought Radxa Zero 3W 1gb. In my future blog post I want to post about it.</p>

<p>4 things:
deliberate practice, 
feedback, 
supportive environment,
passion</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="update" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, January 3, 2025, in an ironic attempt to fix my sleep schedule, I decided not to sleep at all.

Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP</code></p>

<p>Where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YEAR</code> is a four-digit number, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MONTH</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DAY</code> are both two-digit numbers, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MARKUP</code> is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></figure>
